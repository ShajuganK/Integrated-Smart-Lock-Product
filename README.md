🔐 KnoxKey – Smart Door Lock with Knock & Keypad Authentication

📌 Project Overview

KnoxKey is a product-oriented smart door lock system developed as an extension of the Secret Door Knock Pattern Recognition project during Complementary Semester 2.
The system combines knock-pattern recognition with keypad-based password authentication, providing a dual-layer access control mechanism suitable for real-world deployment.

Unlike the initial prototype, this phase focused on complete product design, including schematic development, PCB design, enclosure planning, and hardware validation.
